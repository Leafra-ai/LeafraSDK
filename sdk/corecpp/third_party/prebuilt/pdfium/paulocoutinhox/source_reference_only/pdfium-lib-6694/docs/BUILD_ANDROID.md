# Build for Android

1. Execute all **general** steps

2. Get PDFium:
```python3 make.py build-pdfium-android```

3. Patch:
```python3 make.py patch-android```

4. PDFium Android dependencies
```./build/android/pdfium/build/install-build-deps-android.sh```

5. Compile:
```python3 make.py build-android```

6. Install libraries:
```python3 make.py install-android```

7. Test:
```python3 make.py test-android```

Obs:
- The file **make.py** need be executed with python version 3.
- You need run all steps in a Linux machine (real, vm or docker) to it works.
- With docker you can skip step 2.


## Docker

You can use docker to build and test on local machine before deploy.

Build the image with command:

```docker build -t pdfium-android -f docker/android/Dockerfile docker/android```

Test with command:

```docker run -v ${PWD}:/app -it pdfium-android echo "test"```

Now you can execute any command with pattern:

```docker run -v ${PWD}:/app -it pdfium-android [COMMAND]```

## Docker (macOS arm64)

If you are in a macOS with arm64 processors (M*), build with command:

```docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t pdfium-android -f docker/android/Dockerfile docker/android```

and

```docker run --platform linux/amd64 -v ${PWD}:/app -it pdfium-android echo "test"```
