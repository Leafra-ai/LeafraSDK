# LeafraSDK SQLite Unit Tests

This directory contains comprehensive unit tests for the LeafraSDK SQLite integration, testing database operations, security features, and cross-platform compatibility.

## Test Suites

The tests are organized into two comprehensive suites:

1. **`test_sqlite_basic`** - Core SQLite operations
   - Database creation and opening with path validation
   - Basic SQL operations (CREATE, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE)
   - RAG tables schema verification
   - In-memory database operations
   - Security validation (path traversal prevention)

2. **`test_sqlite_advanced`** - Advanced SQLite features
   - Prepared statements with parameter binding
   - Transaction management (commit, rollback, RAII)
   - Error handling and reporting
   - Data type handling (INTEGER, REAL, TEXT, BLOB, NULL)
   - Column access methods (by index and name)

**Total Coverage:** 117 tests across all critical SQLite functionality

## Platform Testing Status

### ‚úÖ FULLY TESTED & VERIFIED (100% Pass Rate)
- **macOS (Apple Silicon)** - 117/117 tests passing
  - Basic Operations: 46/46 tests ‚úÖ
  - Advanced Features: 71/71 tests ‚úÖ
  - System SQLite integration via macOS SDK
  - Native performance and security
- **iOS Simulator (iPhone 16 Pro, iOS 18.2)** - 117/117 tests passing

         -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=arm64 \
         -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=13.0

# Build tests
make -j$(nproc)

# Run tests on simulator (direct execution)
xcrun simctl spawn booted ./test_sqlite_basic
xcrun simctl spawn booted ./test_sqlite_advanced
```

#### Option 2: Launch New Simulator
```bash
# Build tests (same as above)
# ...

# Launch specific simulator and run tests
xcrun simctl boot "iPhone 16 Pro"
xcrun simctl spawn "iPhone 16 Pro" ./test_sqlite_basic
xcrun simctl spawn "iPhone 16 Pro" ./test_sqlite_advanced
```

### iOS Device

# Set your development team ID
export IOS_DEVELOPMENT_TEAM="YOUR_TEAM_ID"

# Build for iOS Device
mkdir build_ios_device && cd build_ios_device
cmake .. -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=iOS \
         -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=arm64 \

## Storage Locations

### macOS
- **AppStorage:** `~/Library/Application Support/com.leafra.sqlite.<test_name>/`
- **Test Databases:** Created in secure AppStorage location

### iOS Simulator
- **AppStorage:** `/Users/.../Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/.../data/Containers/Data/Application/.../Library/Application Support/`
- **Sandboxed:** Each test app has isolated storage

### iOS Device
- **AppStorage:** Sandboxed application-specific directory
- **Security:** Full iOS security model enforcement

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Database file not found"
- Ensure file manager is properly initialized
- Check AppStorage permissions
- Verify relative path format

#### "SQLite library not found" (Linux)
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev

# CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install sqlite-devel
```

#### iOS Simulator "App not found"
- Ensure simulator is booted
- Check app bundle was created correctly
- Verify deployment target compatibility

#### Code Signing Issues (iOS Device)
- Set valid development team ID
- Ensure device is registered
- Check provisioning profile

### Debug Output

Enable verbose logging by setting environment variable:
```bash
export LEAFRA_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
./test_sqlite_basic
```

## Contributing

When adding new tests:
1. Follow existing test structure and naming conventions
2. Include both positive and negative test cases
3. Test across all supported platforms (currently: macOS ‚úÖ, iOS Simulator ‚úÖ)
4. Update this README with any new requirements or procedures

### Expanding Platform Support

**To add Windows/Linux/Android testing:**
1. **Windows:** Complete CMake configuration for Visual Studio, configure SQLite linking (system or bundled)
2. **Linux:** Complete CMake configuration for GCC/Clang, add system SQLite package integration
3. **Android:** Integrate Android NDK, create Gradle build scripts, configure Android SQLite setup

**Current Implementation Status:**
- Core SQLite integration (`leafra_sqlite.cpp`) is cross-platform ready
- CMake build system has Apple platform support complete
- Test suites are platform-agnostic and ready for expansion
- Only platform-specific build configuration needed for remaining platforms

## Integration with LeafraSDK

These tests validate the SQLite integration used throughout LeafraSDK:
- **Document Storage:** RAG tables for document indexing
- **Embedding Storage:** BLOB storage for vector embeddings
- **Metadata Management:** Structured data storage
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Consistent behavior across platforms

The tests ensure that SQLite operations work reliably across all target platforms with proper security and performance characteristics.
