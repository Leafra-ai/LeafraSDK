This is a test document with multiple paragraphs to demonstrate chunking functionality. 

The LeafraSDK chunking system intelligently splits documents into smaller pieces while preserving context and meaning. Each chunk maintains optimal sizes for language model processing.

This third paragraph adds more content to test the overlap feature. The chunking algorithm ensures that adjacent chunks have some overlap to maintain context continuity between segments.

Finally, this last paragraph completes our test document. The system will create multiple chunks from this content, showing how the chunking algorithm handles different text structures and maintains readability.
